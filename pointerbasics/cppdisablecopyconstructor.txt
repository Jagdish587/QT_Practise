	Sometimes it is recommended do disable copy constrctor and assignment operator 
	like singelton , below is way to achieve it

	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2173746/how-do-i-make-this-c-object-non-copyable

struct NonCopyable {
    NonCopyable & operator=(const NonCopyable&) = delete;
    NonCopyable(const NonCopyable&) = delete;
    NonCopyable() = default;
};

for class subclassing QObject , you can use macro Q_DISABLE_COPY and achieve this 

class MyClass : public QObject {
  Q_OBJECT
  Q_DISABLE_COPY(MyClass) // See macro below
  public:
    QObject() {}
};


#ifdef Q_COMPILER_DELETE_MEMBERS 
# define Q_DECL_EQ_DELETE = delete
#else
# define Q_DECL_EQ_DELETE
#endif

#define Q_DISABLE_COPY(Class) \
  Class(const Class &) Q_DECL_EQ_DELETE;\
  Class &operator=(const Class &) Q_DECL_EQ_DELETE;
